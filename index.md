## SciNLP: Natural Language Processing and Data Mining for Scientific Text

The 1st SciNLP workshop will be at [AKBC 2020](https://www.akbc.ws/2020/)!  

**The exact date of the workshop is still TBD** as we're still waiting more details on an updated schedule since AKBC 2020 has been moved to **virtual**.  For reference, AKBC 2020 was originally scheduled for June 22-24.

The primary goal of this half-day workshop is to bring together researchers from diverse fields
who are interested in extracting and representing knowledge from scientific text, and/or
applications or methods for improving access to and understanding of such knowledge. Such
research includes, but is not limited to:

* **Methods** in natural language processing and data mining for extracting and representing
knowledge from scientific text (e.g. information extraction, entity normalization, discourse
analysis, parsing, summarization, text generation, question answering, knowledge base
construction, weak/distant supervision, crowdsourcing),
* **Applications** of these methods to improving scientific knowledge discovery and/or
understanding (e.g. automated literature review, search and recommender systems,
techniques for data exploration and visualization),
* **Fairness** (e.g. augmented or assistive paper reading, concept simplification, scientific
education and literacy),
* **Science of science** studies (in particular, studies that shed light on phenomena that can
motivate future research in above-mentioned areas), and
* **Datasets**, **Resources** (e.g. treebanks, knowledge bases), and **Tools** (e.g. software
libraries, annotation interfaces) for conducting research in such areas.

We welcome research relevant to processing text in any domain of science (e.g. Biology,
Medicine, Computer Science, Physics, Economics, Sociology, etc.) that can come from a
variety of text sources (e.g. scholarly papers, surveys and technical reports, patents, tweets
by scholars, blogs/tutorials, etc.)

### Call for papers

We welcome submissions of **short abstracts (1 page)** related to the above research areas. Submissions may include previously published results, late-breaking results, work in progress, among other types of scholarly work.  Accepted relevant submissions will be accepted for presentation in the **virtual poster session**, where the abstracts will be available alongside **3 min videos** uploaded by the authors.

To submit an abstract, please send an email to **scinlp@googlegroups.com** with the subject line "SCINLP submission: [TITLE]". Please include:
        
* One-page abstract in PDF format as an attachment.  Since the abstracts will not be reviewed, there is no need to anonymize the submissions.
* Indicate whether any of the authors will be able to present the work in person at the workshop.
* Indicate whether you'd like us to provide a link to the abstract on the workshop website.
* Indicate whether you need an invitation letter for visa purposes.
* Indicate the scientific domain(s) and source(s) of scientific text relevant to the submission; for example, scientific domain could be “Genomics” while source of text could be “Peer-reviewed papers from PubMed”.
