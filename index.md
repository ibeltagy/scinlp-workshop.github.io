## SciNLP: Natural Language Processing and Data Mining for Scientific Text

The 1st SciNLP workshop will be at AKBC 2020!

The primary goal of this half-day workshop is to bring together researchers from diverse fields
who are interested in extracting and representing knowledge from scientific text, and/or
applications or methods for improving access to and understanding of such knowledge. Such
research includes, but is not limited to:

* **Methods** in natural language processing and data mining for extracting and representing
knowledge from scientific text (e.g. information extraction, entity normalization, discourse
analysis, parsing, summarization, text generation, question answering, knowledge base
construction, weak/distant supervision, crowdsourcing),
* **Applications** of these methods to improving scientific knowledge discovery and/or
understanding (e.g. automated literature review, search and recommender systems,
techniques for data exploration and visualization),
* **Fairness** (e.g. augmented or assistive paper reading, concept simplification, scientific
education and literacy),
* **Science** of science studies (in particular, studies that shed light on phenomena that can
motivate future research in above-mentioned areas), and
* **Datasets**, **Resources** (e.g. treebanks, knowledge bases), and **Tools** (e.g. software
libraries, annotation interfaces) for conducting research in such areas.

We welcome research relevant to processing text in any domain of science (e.g. Biology,
Medicine, Computer Science, Physics, Economics, Sociology, etc.) that can come from a
variety of text sources (e.g. scholarly papers, surveys and technical reports, patents, tweets
by scholars, blogs/tutorials, etc.)

### Call for papers

We welcome submissions of short abstracts (1 page) related to the above research areas.
Submissions may include previously published results, late-breaking results, work in progress,
among other types of scholarly work.

We additionally encourage that abstracts indicate the scientific domain(s) and source(s) of
scientific text relevant to the submission; for example, scientific domain could be “Genomics”
while source of text could be “Peer-reviewed papers from PubMed”.
Accepted abstracts will be presented in the poster session.

We aim to have at least 4 invited speakers and a poster session. Depending on the number of
invited speakers who accept, a possible schedule will look like:
