## SciNLP: Natural Language Processing and Data Mining for Scientific Text

The 1st SciNLP workshop will be at [AKBC 2020](https://www.akbc.ws/2020/)!  

SciNLP will be held **virtually** on **June 24th** from **8AM - 1PM (PST)**.

The primary goal of this half-day workshop is to bring together researchers from diverse fields
who are interested in extracting and representing knowledge from scientific text, and/or
applications or methods for improving access to and understanding of such knowledge. Such
research includes, but is not limited to:

* **Methods** in natural language processing and data mining for extracting and representing
knowledge from scientific text (e.g. information extraction, entity normalization, discourse
analysis, parsing, summarization, text generation, question answering, knowledge base
construction, weak/distant supervision, crowdsourcing),
* **Applications** of these methods to improving scientific knowledge discovery and/or
understanding (e.g. automated literature review, search and recommender systems,
techniques for data exploration and visualization),
* **Fairness** (e.g. augmented or assistive paper reading, concept simplification, scientific
education and literacy),
* **Science of science** studies (in particular, studies that shed light on phenomena that can
motivate future research in above-mentioned areas), and
* **Datasets**, **Resources** (e.g. treebanks, knowledge bases), and **Tools** (e.g. software
libraries, annotation interfaces) for conducting research in such areas.

We welcome research relevant to processing text in any domain of science (e.g. Biology,
Medicine, Computer Science, Physics, Economics, Sociology, etc.) that can come from a
variety of text sources (e.g. scholarly papers, surveys and technical reports, patents, tweets
by scholars, blogs/tutorials, etc.)

### Call for papers

We welcome submissions of **short abstracts (1 page)** related to the above research areas. Submissions may include previously published results, late-breaking results, work in progress, among other types of scholarly work.  Relevant submissions will be accepted for presentation in the **virtual poster session**.

To submit an abstract, please send an email to **scinlp@googlegroups.com** with the subject line "SCINLP submission: [TITLE]". Please include:
        
* One-page abstract in PDF format as an attachment.  Abstracts will be lightly reviewed to ensure that the topic is within the scope of the workshop.
* Indicate which of the authors will be presenting the work.  We require each accepted work to provide a **2 minute video** recording of the presentation.
* Indicate the scientific domain(s) and source(s) of scientific text relevant to the submission; for example, scientific domain could be “Genomics” while source of text could be “Peer-reviewed papers from PubMed”.

Please use the same [LaTeX template](https://github.com/akbc-conference/style-files/blob/master/akbc-latex.zip?raw=true) that you'd use for submitting to AKBC.

All accepted submissions and videos will be made available online prior to the workshop and remain accessible afterwards.

If you have a disability and require accommodation in order to fully participate in the workshop, please let us know and we'll be in touch to discuss how we can best address your needs.

### Invited speakers

We're excited to announce our invited speakers:

* Asma Ben-Abacha, National Library of Medicine
* Doug Downey, Allen Institute for AI
* David Jurgens, University of Michigan
* Ryan McDonald, Google
* Vivi Nastase, University of Stuttgart
* Hoifung Poon, Microsoft Research

### Tentative schedule

The tentative schedule is:

Total estimated 285 minutes (4.75 hrs).  All times are in PST:

* 8:00       - START
* 8:00-8:25  - Invited talk 1 (25 min)
* 8:25-8:50  - Invited talk 2 (25 min)
* 8:50-9:15  - Invited talk 3 (25 min)
* 9:15-9:40  - Invited talk 4 (25 min)
* 9:40-10:05  - Poster session (30 min)
* 10:10-10:35 - Invited talk 5 (25 min)
* 10:35-11:00 - Invited talk 6 (25 min)
* 11:00-11:25 - Invited talk 7 (25 min)
* 11:25-11:50 - Invited talk 8 (25 min)
* 11:50-12:15 - Invited talk 9 (25 min)
* 12:15-12:45 - Panel discussion (30 min)
* 12:45       - END

Each invited talk is roughly 25 min (which includes a few minutes of QA and buffer time for transitions).

### Panel discussion

We additionally have a 30 minute panel discussion with a few of our speakers who collaborate with biomedical domain experts with regards to NLP and text mining over scientific literature.  

The focus of this session will be discussing the role of NLP and text mining over scientific text as it pertains to the current virus epidemic -- What are useful short/long-term endeavors What are we doing that isn't helpful?  How can we best connect and collaborate with domain experts?  What are challenges that prevent us from being helpful?

We will be curating questions from the audience beforehand (as well as live during the discussion).
